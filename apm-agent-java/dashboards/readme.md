## Java Dashboards and Visualizations

A Kibana dashboard displays a collection of visualizations and searches.
This is a collection of dashboards, visualizations, and searches that you can use to organize and view your Elastic APM Java Agent data.

### Installation

Dashboards are imported on the **Management > Saved objects** page. Full documentation on this process is available in [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/managing-saved-objects.html).

After importing, visit the [Dashboard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html) tab to view and edit your imported dashboards.
